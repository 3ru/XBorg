<summary>From a technical standpoint, what is your competitive edge? </summary>

From a technological perspective, the implementation of a credential network within the realm of gaming is a truly distinctive innovation. However, it is similar to the Lens protocol, which uses social data to construct a network. Our platform, on the other hand, harnesses gaming data to establish a gaming-specific data network. While other endeavors, such as Galxe, have focused on constructing a credential network, they do not have the same dedicated focus on gaming.

Our technological advancements can be attributed to our adept integration of gaming data through various distribution platforms (including but not limited to Steam, FaceIt, and Riot Games) and the creation of custom API integrations with games. To further differentiate our platform, we have developed proprietary applications on top of the network, such as the fan engagement app, decentralized gaming communities, and the soulbound launchpad, contributing to our unique credential network.
