<summary>Why XBorg?</summary>

In today's society, where leisure time is becoming increasingly abundant, players spend countless hours immersed in gaming worlds. Yet, the data generated from these experiences is often undervalued and fragmented across multiple games. XBorg recognizes the value of players' time and seeks to make their data meaningful and valuable.

The issue of fragmented player data is compounded by the fact that gamers are not always rewarded for their contributions to a game's success. Despite being an integral part of the gaming ecosystem, players often fail to perceive any value generated by their gameplay. This significant problem affects countless gamers and warrants a solution.

<summary>What is a Gaming Credential Network? </summary>

The credential network is like a personal gaming data hub for each player. It aggregates all their gaming credentials from different games and apps into one ID, like their performance on a game, the gaming communities they belong to, and the number of tournaments they have won. It's the digital identity of players.&#x20;

Our system tracks three types of user data:&#x20;

1. Esports engagement
2. Gaming performance
3. Social/fan activity

We gather this data from popular platforms like Steam, FaceIt, Riot Games, Twitter, Discord, and on-chain sources.&#x20;

To put it technically, the Gaming Credential Network uses players' soulbound tokens (nontransferable NFTs) to store their metrics securely. Our advanced data aggregator, XBorg, ensures gamers fully own their data.

The credential network is the building block allowing the creation of enhanced gaming applications and games connected to the identity of players.

Therefore, imagine the Lens protocol for gaming.

<summary>What is the Gaming Application Network? </summary>

The gaming application network is a collection of gaming apps that use a player's digital identity. Our credential network can be used to create more advanced gaming apps, like a tournament platform that matches players based on their history, a GameFi soulbound launchpad, or a gaming dating app that matches players based on their credentials. Brands can also use this network for user acquisition based on player data. The gaming application network offers endless possibilities for a more personalized and enjoyable gaming experience.\
\
We intend the use of the credential network to be permissionless such that any developers can build new cool apps :)&#x20;
