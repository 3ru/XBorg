What is a Gaming Credential Network?

The credential network is like a personal gaming data hub for each player. It aggregates all their gaming credentials from different games and apps into one ID, like their performance on a game, the gaming communities they belong to, and the number of tournaments they have won. It's the digital identity of players.

Our system tracks three types of user data:

We gather this data from popular platforms like Steam, FaceIt, Riot Games, Twitter, Discord, and on-chain sources.

To put it technically, the Gaming Credential Network uses players' soulbound tokens (nontransferable NFTs) to store their metrics securely. Our advanced data aggregator, XBorg, ensures gamers fully own their data.

The credential network is the building block allowing the creation of enhanced gaming applications and games connected to the identity of players.

Therefore, imagine the Lens protocol for gaming.
