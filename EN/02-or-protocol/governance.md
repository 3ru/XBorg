# Governance

> Though currently partially centralized, is moving to a fully decentralized system of governance. This transition will be a paramount step for the ecosystem. The following section will outline timelines and concepts that are important while building towards this decentralized future.

<summary>Is XBorg a DAO? </summary>

Currently, XBorg is predominantly centralized, although Prometheus holders and councils partially influence the governance of the ecosystem. In essence, community voting is used to inform specific decisions.

Following the Token Generation Event (TGE), XBorg aims to progress toward complete decentralization. However, it is clear that the process of decentralization cannot be immediate and must be approached with patience and care.&#x20;

<summary>After TGE, how will the governance system work? </summary>

The governance will be applied via quadratic voting, the total XBG tokens held are multiplied by the in-protocol status. This mechanism ensures that larger token holders do not have an accessive impact on the governance and that those who provide value to the ecosystem (via the in-protocol status and XP system) have increased weight in the ecosystem.&#x20;

<summary>What kind of decisions will the DAO have? </summary>

As XBorg moves towards full decentralization, its governance will be entrusted with an expansive range of decision-making powers. However, it is worth noting that certain aspects of the project will be exempt from voting, such as the exposure of sensitive data that could potentially jeopardize the longevity of the project or the pursuit of initiatives that are legally questionable or may harm XBorg's reputation or impact previous legal, commercial or financial relationships.

The core contributors will play a supportive and guiding role in facilitating effective DAO decision-making. The types of decisions that will be subject to voting include new product offerings, application feature updates, modifications to fee mechanisms within the protocol, funding DAO activities, controlling DAO expenses and vetoing significant foreseeable expenses, guiding strategic market expansion, and providing input on the composition of the core contributor members.

<summary>Why decentralizing XBorg? </summary>

At XBorg, we recognize the paramount importance of being closely connected to our user base, given our role as a credential and application layer for players. In anticipation of a future where technical barriers to entry are minimal, we believe that the community is the most invaluable asset of a protocol. Our unwavering mission is to empower players across the globe.

With the vision of becoming the largest gaming ecosystem that builds consumer applications by and for players, XBorg understands the sensitive nature of player data and credentials. We firmly believe that centralized entities cannot adequately handle such information and that decentralized alternatives will ultimately prevail.

<summary>How do you incentivize community participation? </summary>

To foster a robust and engaged community, we at XBorg have implemented a governance structure that emphasizes active participation. Specifically, we have set a 10% quorum requirement for governance votes, which ensures that a significant portion of the community has a voice in important decisions. Additionally, to incentivize community members to take part in governance, we will offer rewards in the form of XBG tokens for a predetermined period of time. This approach serves to promote the democratic and participatory ethos that underpins our vision for XBorg as a decentralized gaming ecosystem.
