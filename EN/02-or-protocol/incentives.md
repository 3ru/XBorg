> XBorg has always said that all must experience the value they generate, and we have developed our ecosystem under these principles. The following section will highlight the various current and future mechanisms that will offer value to active members of the protocol.

<summary>Why give incentives? </summary>

XBorg operates under the guiding principle of incentivizing actors who contribute positively to its ecosystem. Whether one is a devoted community member, an innovative developer, or an active participant in the protocol's utilization, XBorg recognizes the importance of rewarding merit and promoting a meritocratic culture. Centralized value accrual runs counter to the notion of a community-centric philosophy. Thus XBorg remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring the equitable distribution of rewards across its entire ecosystem.
