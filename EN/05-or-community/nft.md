# NFT

> The Prometheus NFT is the highest status of the XBorg protocol. If you are familiar with the SwissBorg ecosystem, it's similar to the Genesis status but locked to a 1'111 fixed supply. Possessing a Prometheus NFT is a testament to one's significant contributions to the XBorg ecosystem. It offers a plethora of advantages, including access to airdrops, governance capabilities, and in-game privileges, among other valuable benefits.

<summary>Historically, how much perks have been perceived by Prometheus NFTs? </summary>

Considering the mint price of $400, it can be estimated that Prometheus non-fungible token owners have received approximately $220 worth of perks. This represents a significant percentage, roughly 50%, of the initial mint value. Notably, this can be primarily attributed to the airdrop of the Lens handle, which has conferred considerable value upon Prometheus NFT holders.

<summary>How do you plan to retain the value of the Prometheus NFT after the XBorg token airdrop?</summary>

We believe the utilities and the ecosystem's growth will outweigh the selling pressure from those only here to yield the airdrop. If this negative impact becomes excessively burdensome, the DAO retains the option to undertake a buyback of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from its treasury.

Yes, the NFT will be revealed later this year.&#x20;

<summary>What if I sell my NFT during the vested period?</summary>

If an investor sells the NFT during the vested period, the non-claimed rewards will be nullified. However, the Prometheus governance could decide otherwise.

<details>

<summary>Is it possible to align the value of Prometheus NFT with XBG token?</summary>

It is possible to align the value of the NFT and the XBG token. The Prometheus NFT is a very scarce asset, with only 1'111 in circulation. The staking yield of the XBG token will be determined by the XP level of a user and the user's status in the app. As such, Prometheus holders will enjoy a higher staking yield. There is no dilution of value with regard to the equity, as no equity will be sold. The whole value of XBorg is redirected toward the DAO and hence the XBG token.

<details>

<summary>How long is the vesting period for the Airdrop of XBG?</summary>

The vesting period is of 12 months, vested linearly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>It was said that Prometheus NFT holders get additional allocation to buy XBG tokens. How big is the allocation per NFT?</summary>

The private allocation for the Prometheus community is uncapped, meaning that allocations are guaranteed for Prometheus holders. We aim to raise around $500'000 from the NFT holders.&#x20;
