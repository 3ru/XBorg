# Initial Team Offerings

> Initial Team Offerings or ITOs are one of the new technologies introduced by XBorg. The objective is to develop a tokenized layer where players can create, fundraise, and buy teams, and in doing so have power of governance over their roadmap and trajectory, and derive monetary value for being supporters of their ecosystem.
