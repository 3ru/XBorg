Why can't you give an exact TGE date?

As a team, we believe that the crypto outlook towards the end of 2023 and close to Bitcoin halvings will be positive. The XBorg team is currently engaging in talks with top-tier exchanges, whose opinions hold considerable weight in determining the ideal timing for token listing. It's important to note that launching a token during periods of uncertain liquidity and interest in alternative coins can pose a risk.

In addition, we recognize that a token's value lies in the strength of the ecosystem it operates in. Therefore, our goal is to cultivate a user base of at least 100,000 prior to launching the token.

Looking ahead, our team is optimistic about the crypto market's potential towards the end of 2023, particularly in light of upcoming Bitcoin halvings.
