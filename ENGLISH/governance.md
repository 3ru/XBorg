# Governance

What kind of decisions will the DAO have?

As XBorg moves towards full decentralization, its governance will be entrusted with an expansive range of decision-making powers. However, it is worth noting that certain aspects of the project will be exempt from voting, such as the exposure of sensitive data that could potentially jeopardize the longevity of the project or the pursuit of initiatives that are legally questionable or may harm XBorg's reputation or impact previous legal, commercial or financial relationships.

The core contributors will play a supportive and guiding role in facilitating effective DAO decision-making. The types of decisions that will be subject to voting include new product offerings, application feature updates, modifications to fee mechanisms within the protocol, funding DAO activities, controlling DAO expenses and vetoing significant foreseeable expenses, guiding strategic market expansion, and providing input on the composition of the core contributor members.
