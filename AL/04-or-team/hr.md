<summary>How do you attract employees to the company?</summary>

At XBorg, we recognize that the foundation of our success lies in the caliber of talent that we attract and retain.

<summary>What are the average compensations at XBorg?</summary>

At XBorg, we have implemented a compensation structure that features an average remuneration of **$3,200 USDC**, supplemented by incentivization in the form of **XBG tokens**.

<summary>What is the HR plan for the coming 18 months?</summary>

To expand our operational capabilities and enhance the performance of our infrastructure, we are looking to hire more engineers, specifically in the areas of backend development, smart contract engineering, and DevOps. We aim to bring 15 highly skilled engineers on board over the next 18 months. In addition to our technical team, we are also planning to recruit professionals in business development, legal counsel, and accounting to support the growth of the protocol. We will issue grants to third-party developers as we scale the number of ecosystem applications.

<summary>What is the time commitment of each of the founders?</summary>

Louis is the sole founder of XBorg, fully immersed in his role and devoting his undivided attention to the realm of XBorg, with no other concurrent ventures vying for his time and focus.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the founders' salary (including benefits, cars, etc.)?</summary>

The founder's salary is **3,000 USDC**, below the team average. No other perks are derived.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are the technical developments of the protocol done in-house?</summary>

At XBorg, we believe in developing technical solutions in-house, utilizing the expertise of our dedicated engineering team. We view outsourcing to contractors as a short-term solution, lacking the benefits of long-term investment in our own team's capabilities. As such, we prioritize building our internal team and fostering their growth to maximize the value of our technical developments.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do you motivate people in your team?</summary>

To align the interests of our team members with those of the XBorg ecosystem, we have devised a compensation framework that features a combination of USDC-based remuneration alongside an allocation of XBG tokens sourced from the Team token supply. This approach incentivizes and motivates our team members toward attaining our collective objectives while fostering a sense of shared ownership and alignment of interests.
