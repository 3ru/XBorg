What is the XBorg’s approach to risk management, let’s say we strike another long bear market?

At XBorg, we take financial risk management very seriously. Our lean approach has resulted in a monthly burn rate of $40,000, which covers the salaries of our 12 full-time employees. With an average salary of $3.3k per employee per month, we have maintained a high level of expertise and efficiency within our team while ensuring we have ample runway to build and iterate on our roadmap. While we do not require additional funds, we recognize the need to anticipate our future growth and scale up our technical team accordingly. As such, we will be seeking additional funding to support this expansion.
